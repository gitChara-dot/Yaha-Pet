# Yaha-Pet!

A simple desktop pet application featuring characters from the "Chiikawa" universe, created with Python and PyQt6. The characters will roam your desktop, play animations, and react to your interactions.

## ✨ Features

* Autonomous Behavior: Characters walk around the screen on their own.
* Interactive: Drag and drop the characters anywhere on your screen.
* Lively Animations: Features several sprite animations for different actions like walking and dancing.
* Sound Effects: Characters have unique sounds for animations and interactions.
* System Tray Control: Manage your spawned characters through a system tray icon menu.
* Customizable: Don't like a certain animation? Sound is too loud? Change it all on the tray control.
